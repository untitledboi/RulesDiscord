# Rules
### Respectful Communication
No hate speech, harassment, or discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or nationality.
Engage in debates or discussions respectfully, without personal attacks or inflammatory language.
Any form of trolling, spamming, or flaming is prohibited and will result in an immediate warning or ban.
### No NSFW/Inappropriate Content
Sharing NSFW (Not Safe for Work) content is strictly prohibited, even in private messages, unless in designated 18+ channels (if allowed).
This includes, but is not limited to, pornography, extreme violence, or any other inappropriate content.
Discussions of illegal activities, drugs, or harmful behavior are not allowed.
### Follow Discord Terms
All members must adhere to Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
Violating Discord’s guidelines will result in immediate action, including bans or reports to Discord.
### No Advertising/Self Promo
Advertising of personal projects, servers, social media, or commercial services is only allowed in designated channels.
Promoting scams, phishing links, or unsolicited services is strictly forbidden.
### Use The Right Channels
Stick to the topic of each channel. Off-topic messages will be deleted, and persistent offenders will receive warnings.
Avoid posting the same content or question in multiple channels (no cross-posting).
### No Doxxing/Sharing Private Information
Sharing any kind of personal or private information (your own or others) is strictly forbidden.
This includes real names, addresses, phone numbers, and other private data.
### Mod decisions are final
Moderators and administrators reserve the right to warn, mute, kick, or ban users at their discretion.
Any complaints or concerns regarding moderation should be directed privately to the staff team.
### No Exploit or Hacks
Any form of exploiting, hacking, or using bots/scripts to manipulate server features or gain an unfair advantage is prohibited.
Reporting exploits or vulnerabilities to the staff team is encouraged and appreciated.
### Voice Chat Etiquette
No voice changers, soundboards, or intentionally disruptive noise unless explicitly allowed in specific channels.
Harassment, bullying, or any behavior intended to disturb the peace of the voice channel will result in a mute or ban.
### Bot Usage
Use bot commands only in the appropriate bot channels to prevent clogging up chat spaces.
Abusing bots, such as spamming commands or exploiting bot functions, will result in loss of bot privileges.
### Role-Specific Rules
Users in certain roles may have specific rules or privileges they must adhere to. Abuse of these privileges will result in removal of roles or other disciplinary actions.
Staff and moderators are expected to be role models and should not misuse their powers.
### Mature Content Restrictions
Channels designated as "mature" must only be accessible to users who are 18+. Users found to be lying about their age will be banned.
Mature channels must still follow guidelines on respect, no NSFW content, and discussions that are inappropriate or harmful.
### Rate Limiting And Flood Control
Excessive messaging, including repeated messages, mass tagging, or spamming reactions, will trigger rate limiting. Continued abuse will result in a mute or kick.
Use pings and mentions responsibly. Do not @everyone or @here unless it is necessary.
### Usernames And Avatars
Usernames and profile pictures must be appropriate. Inappropriate names or avatars (containing offensive language, slurs, or suggestive images) will result in a request for change or a ban.
### No Impersonating
Impersonating staff, bots, or other users is strictly forbidden. This includes using similar usernames, avatars, or behavior designed to deceive other members.
### Use Common Sense
Not every possible situation is covered by the rules above. If you think something might be wrong, don’t do it. If you’re unsure, ask a moderator before acting.
I know it feels like too much rules to you but Just try to follow them the best u can, we wont strike at you.
